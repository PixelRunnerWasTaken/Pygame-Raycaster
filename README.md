# Pygame-Raycaster
This is a simple raycaster I wrote in pygame a while back. I have decided to release the code and continue working on it.

Currently rewriting the code for readability and scalability. It is very messy right now and runs slowly. I mainly just put it together to learn raycasting.

It features texturemapped walls that run slowly because pygame can't handle images at large scales, a panoramic skybox that may or may not be synced with the player's actual rotation, and a very crude collision detection system that doesn't work properly when a player grazes a wall at the corner. Every one of these issues will be fixed after I finish making the code make sense.

Any help is appreciated
